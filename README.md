### Hi! I am a frontend developer that primarily uses React :hammer:

I am majoring in Computer Science at the Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

I like to create applications that people can use. For example, Dragify is an extension that allows you to thoroughly customize the appearance of your new tab through drag and drop functionality.
